# Rolemaster Standard System for Foundry VTT

## Intro

This is an in development implementation of the Rolemaster Standard System for FoundryVTT. All rights to the system remain property of Iron Crown Enterprises (http://ironcrown.com/). This system will not include any of the book content and aims to provide only what is on the reproducable character sheet. If you need access to the Rolemaster Standard System please purchase a copy of the PDF's via Drive Thru RPG (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/461/Iron-Crown-Enterprises).  

Early project goals include:
 - A functionaing character sheet that automates some of the basic maths.
 - A dice roller that allows you to perform the most common rolls in the system.
 - A basic combat tracker

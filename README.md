# Rolemaster Standard System for Foundry VTT

## Introduction
This is an in-development implementation of the Rolemaster Standard System for FoundryVTT. All rights to the system remain property of Iron Crown Enterprises (http://ironcrown.com/). This system will not include any of the book content and aims to provide only what is on the character sheet.

If you need access to the Rolemaster Standard System you may be out of luck as the system has been out of print for some time. However it's successor Rolemaster Fantasy Roleplaying is broadly compatible and can be purchased as a PDF via Drive Thru RPG here: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91995/Rolemaster-Fantasy-Role-Playing?cPath=1361_6495

## How to Use
Download the latest release from this repository and then extract the rmss folder. Drag it into the systems folder of your FoundryVTT Data Directory. More detailed instructions can be found here in the docs directory.

If you are using this system I highly recommend the "Simple Dice Roller" module which will allow you to roll dice easily while this feature is in development. You can install it in the Foundry Modules section or you can visit the following link for more instructions: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/simple-dice-roller/

## Goals/ToDo
Project goals include:
 - A functionaing character sheet that automates some of the basic maths.
 - A dice roller that allows you to perform the most common rolls in the system.
 - A basic combat tracker

I maintain a public Trello board here where I log my work items: https://trello.com/b/JkXd5EGx/rmss-for-foundryvtt-features

## About Me
My name is Anthony, I'm a DevOps Engineer who has been playing Roleplaying Games since the mid 80's. I've been involved in numerous small programming projects. This system is by far the largest thing I've done. If the code here is awful it's because I'm learning CSS/Javascript as I go.

## Credits
This system is based on:
 - The Foundry VTT Boilerplate system by Asacolips. (https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate)
 - The video tutorials by CÃ©dric Hauteville you can watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFV9z59nkHDccUbRXVt623UdloPTclIrz

This system uses less for CSS. If you change the CSS and need to rebuild it you can see a good installation guide for Less on VSCode at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css#_transpiling-sass-and-less-into-css
